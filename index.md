# 👋 Hi, I'm Sathwik Reddy

I help businesses make smarter, faster decisions using data, dashboards, and optimized processes.

With a Master’s in IT Project Management and a background in aviation, I bridge the gap between technical teams and business goals. Whether I’m validating business logic in SQL or mapping complex workflows in Visio, I thrive on turning raw information into clear, measurable action.
