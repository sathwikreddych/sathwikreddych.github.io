I’m **Sathwik Reddy**, a Business Analyst with a **Master's of Science in Information Technology Project Management** (Indiana Wesleyan University) and a **Master's of Science in Aviation** (JNTU Hyderabad). In my current role as a Business Analyst Intern at Progress Solutions I:

- Conducted UAT and used SQL to validate business logic, ensuring 95 percent post‑launch accuracy.  
- Documented and optimized business processes with Visio, and translated stakeholder needs into Agile user stories and functional specs.

Previously at **CYIENT/Pratt & Whitney** I integrated engine‑maintenance data into SAP and used SQL + Power BI to detect anomalies—boosting forecast accuracy by 20 percent. As a Data Analyst Intern at **Lince Soft Solutions** I cleaned and transformed datasets with SQL and Power Query, and built Tableau dashboards that slashed manual reporting by 30 percent.

I excel at turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights, mapping and automating workflows, and collaborating across global teams to deliver accurate, compliant solutions in fast‑paced environments.
